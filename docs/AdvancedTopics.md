### 1.1 Authentication

In the OBiBa Opal-DataSHIELD ecosystem, users can authenticate by providing their *username* and *password* credentials to gain access to resources. Authentication ensures secure access and protects data integrity by verifying the identity of each user.

Required Credentials:
* **Username**
    - The unique identifier associated with a user's account in Opal.
    - A valid username must be paired with the corresponding password for successful authentication.

* **Password**
    - The secret key that verifies the userâ€™s identity, ensuring access is restricted to authorized individuals.
    - A valid password must be paired with the correct username for successful login.

Authentication Workflow:
1. **User Login:** Enter both username and password credentials.
2. **Verification:** The system validates the credentials. If verified, access is granted to the specified resources; otherwise, the login attempt is denied.
3. **Access Control:** Upon successful authentication, the system applies predefined access controls based on the user's role, permissions, and associated datasets.
